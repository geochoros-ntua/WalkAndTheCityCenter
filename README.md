# Walk & the City Center

The <a href="http://geochoros.survey.ntua.gr/walkandthecitycenter/">Walk & the City Center</a> web-GIS platform developed by GeoCHOROS Research group at the National Technical University of Athens and provides 17 data indicators concering the microscale environmental characteristics of European central urban areas. The aggregated indicators at city center level and the more detailed pre-processed density maps help urban planners, researchers, and decision makers to detect pedestrian infrastructure deficiencies and get a better understanding about public space quality issues. To collect the raw  data, we applied a hybrid method combining GIS and a virtual street obervation instrument. Further methodological details about the data collection process can be seen in our data article published by Data in Brief Journal.
